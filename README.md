🌌 3D Solar System Simulation (Three.js)

I built a complete 3D Solar System simulation using Three.js.
This project demonstrates my skills in 3D rendering, scene creation, object animation, and user interaction using pure JavaScript (no CSS animations).

🚀 Features
    
    🌞 Sun at the center acting as the main light source
    
    🪐 8 orbiting planets with textures, rotations, and realistic lighting
    
    🎛️ Adjustable orbital speed for each planet via sliders
    
    ⏯️ Pause/Resume animation button
    
    🔄 Toggle button to show/hide speed controls
    
    🌌 Starfield background for space effect
    
    🏷️ Planet names displayed on each planet and below sliders
